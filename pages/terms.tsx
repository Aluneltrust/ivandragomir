                <Text align="left" fontSize='x2' fontFamily="inherit" mt={2}>
                Upon acquiring an NFT, you are thereby presented with three options: you can retain the NFT in its digital form for non-commercial, personal use, sell the purchased NFT or opt to imprint it onto physical products for commercial purposes. Should you decide to commercialize the purchased NFT by transferring its imagery onto tangible goods, it is mandatory for you to reach out to Authentiplus™ Certification Program, accessible at domain www.Authentiplus.com. There, you can inquire on how to receive comprehensive guidance regarding the extent of your rights and limitations (&quot;Licensing Agreement&quot;) pertaining to the commercialization of the NFT on physical products. This step ensures adherence to specific protocols and preserves the reputation of our IP and integrity of the NFT's usage in physical merchandise sales.

                For the resale of an NFT, the Licensor, IVAN DRAGOMIR™, imposes a fee amounting to 90% of the sale price. However, IVAN DRAGOMIR™ does not levy charges for gas or network fees associated with the transaction. These additional expenses, including any costs incurred for the transaction or payment processing, are handled and paid directly to the payment processors, or blockchain validators. As IVAN DRAGOMIR™ does not collect these ancillary costs, it is unable to issue refunds for them.
